### Description

This is code for learning project "A Small File System" of the course "Rock the JVM! Scala and Functional Programming for Beginners" (by Daniel Cioc√Ærlan).

This code simulates the code in the lectures, but there're little dirrerencies in formatting, some additional comments and some values are explicitly specified by their types for better understanding. At some point I added my own command "info" to see inner information about state of the system.

Development environment:
* Language: Scala 2.12
* Project SDK: 1.8
* IDE: IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2.5
